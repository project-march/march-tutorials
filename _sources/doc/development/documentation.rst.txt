Documentation
=============
.. inclusion-introduction-start

This tutorial will teach you how to build the documentation locally and contribute to its development.

.. inclusion-introduction-end

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
These tutorials are written in `rst <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, an easy-to-understand plaintext markup language.
It is then build by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ using the `rosdoc_lite <http://wiki.ros.org/rosdoc_lite>`_ package.
You can either build the documentation locally when following the tutorials or deploy it to `GitHub pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ with the help of `Travis <https://travis-ci.org>`_.

Building locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow these steps to be able to build the documentation locally.

Clone the repository
--------------------
Add the following entry to your ``.rosinstall`` file (recommended):

.. code-block:: yaml

  - git:
      local-name: march_tutorials
      uri: https://github.com/project-march/tutorials

And use wstool to update your workspace:

.. code::

  cd ~/march_ws
  wstool update -t src

Or clone the repository manually in your source directory:

.. code::

  cd ~/march_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/project-march/tutorials march_tutorials

.. note:: The local repository should be called ``march_tutorials`` instead of the repository name ``tutorials`` to ensure we can uniquely access the launchfiles.

Install rosdoc_lite and Sphinx
------------------------------
We use the package rosdoc_lite to generate the documentation with Sphinx

.. code::

  sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rosdoc-lite


Install Gem and html-proofer
----------------------------
Gem is a package manager for Ruby, we will use it to install `html-proofer <https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer>`_.
html-proofer is a tool that can validate your generated html for mistakes like broken links or missing images.

.. code::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt install ruby-full

  # Check if ruby and gem got installed correctly
  ruby --version
  gem --version

  sudo gem update --system
  sudo gem install html-proofer

Install Additional dependencies
-------------------------------
Pygit is used so we can tell Sphinx what branch we are on. That way links to GitHub files can be verified against the proper branch.
This prevents html-proofer from not being able to find newly added files on develop, as it checks against the current branch.
Furthermore, we use the sphinx-rtd-theme for the theme of the pages.
You can install both packages from the Ubuntu repositories:

.. code::

  sudo apt install python-pygit2 python-sphinx-rtd-theme


Generate the html
-----------------
Simply run the :rootdir:`build_locally <build_locally.sh>` script to generate the docs and automatically open them in your browser.

.. code::

  cd ~/march_ws/src/march_tutorials
  ./build_locally.sh

.. warning::
  If you already have sphinx installed, you might get the following error:

  .. code::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/march/.local/bin/sphinx-build", line 7, in <module>
        from sphinx.cmd.build import main
      File "/home/march/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sphinx/cmd/build.py", line 39
        file=stderr)
            ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    stdout:

  Fix it by uninstalling sphinx

  .. code::

    pip uninstall sphinx

.. warning::
  You might get the following error if sphinx is installed using pip3:

  .. code::

    Exception occurred:
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 222, in _call_with_frames_removed
      File "/home/olav/march_ws/src/march_tutorials/_scripts/tutorialformatter.py", line 121
        print 'tutorialformatter.py error: sub-tutorial %s not found.' % sub_name
                                                                     ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

  You can fix this by uninstalling python3 sphinx:

  .. code::

    pip3 uninstall sphinx

.. note::
  If you have added new files but not pushed to GitHub yet, html-proofer will probably complain about invalid links.
  Push your files and build locally again to solve this problem.

sphinx-autobuild
-----------------------
`sphinx-autobuild <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/>`_ is a tool that
watches your doc files and live updates your changes.

You can install it with pip:

.. code::

  pip install --user sphinx-autobuild

Start the auto build:

.. code::

  sphinx-autobuild . build/html

When you go to ``localhost:8000`` it should open the documentation and live refresh
when a file is changed and saved to disk.

Deploy with Travis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We make use of the `Travis deploy <http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment>`_ feature to deploy our generated documentation to GitHub pages.
Please check the :rootdir:`.travis.yml of this repository <.travis.yml>` for the details.

Add a new tutorial
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adding a new tutorial is as simple as creating a new ``.rst`` file.
To make sure it shows up in the Table of Contents, add it to the :rootdir:`index.rst <index.rst>` under a ``.. toctree::`` directive

.. tip:: If you are creating a new package description, make sure to base it off the :codedir:`package template <march_packages/template.rst>`
