march_input_device
==================

Overview
--------
The march_input_device is the software running on the |march| input device. The input device is used
to give input to the software running on the |march|.


Communication
-------------
The communication between the input device and the |march| is done with `rosserial <http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial>`_.
This can be run wired via usb cable or wireless via wifi connection.

Sending messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:march:`Gait Instruction Message <march_shared_resources/msg/GaitInstruction.msg>` This is an instruction to start
the sent gait right now, if this is possible.

:march:`Stop Message <march_shared_resources/msg/GaitInstruction.msg>` This message can stop a repeating gait (such
as walk). After receiving the stop message, the exoskeleton will go to the standing pose.

`Stay Alive Message <http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Time.html>`_  Every loop a stay alive message is
sent. This way :ref:`march-safety-label` can detect when the input device loses connection.

Receiving messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`Gait Instruction Response Message <http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Bool.html>`_  This message
indicates that the last gait instruction is handled. The value represents success or rejection.

Set correct ubuntu permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following error can occur when trying to access the ttyUSB port:

.. code::

   Cannot open /dev/ttyUSB0: Permission denied

To make sure your user is allowed to access the port, add your user to the required groups:

.. code::

  sudo usermod -a -G tty <your_username>
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout <your_username>

Now log out on your computer and log back in, the error should be resolved.

How to run wired
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upload the code on the input device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Skip this section if the correct code for running wired is already on the input device. More detailed information on how
to run and upload the code see the :input-device:`ReadMe <>`.

- Comment :code:`#define USE_WIRELESS` in the main.cpp.
- Upload to input device.

Start the software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Make sure the jumper cap in the electronics holder is placed so the input device is powered via the USB cable rather than via batteries.
- Connect the input device via usb cable, this powers and launches the input device automatically.
- Type in a terminal:

.. code::

    roslaunch march_launch serial_connection.launch tcp:=false


How to run wireless
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: Make sure the pc that needs to receive the messages and the input device are on the same network.

Upload the code on the input device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Skip this section if the correct code for running wireless is already on the input device. More detailed information on how
to run and upload the code see the :input-device:`ReadMe <>`.

- Type in terminal: :code:`hostname -I` Remember the output, this is the hostname. You have to use this address for the next instructions. From this point we call this value **your_hostname**.
- Uncomment :code:`#define USE_WIRELESS` in the *main.cpp*.
- Change :code:`IPAddress server(x, x, x, x)` to :code:`IPAddress server(your_hostname)` in the :input-device:`wireless_connection.h <include/wireless_connection.h>`
- Upload to input device.

.. note:: If you want to change the network name and password that the input device uses: Change **ssid** and **password** in the :input-device:`wireless_connection.h <include/wireless_connection.h>`


Start the software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Type in every terminal you are going to use:

.. code::

    export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<your_hostname>:11311/

- Type in a terminal:

.. code::

    roslaunch march_launch serial_connection.launch

- Make sure the batteries are charged and in the input device.
- Make sure the jumper cap in the electronics holder is placed so the input device is powered by the batteries rather than via a USB cable.
- Press the on/off button to turn on the input device. The button is located on the electronics holder of the input device.

.. _how-to-add-a-gait-label:

How to add a gait
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Make new screens for the new gait. 
- Make sure the new gait/new screens fit in the menu & create a selected & activated screen for the new gait.
- Put the screens on the SD card. Use the 4D Systems Workshop4 IDE software for this.
- Create a new state, a new gait, in the *StateMachine.cpp*.

.. code::

   case State::NewGait:;
   
- Implement the correct button actions which cause state transitions to the code. For example:

.. code::
    
   if(joystickPress == "PUSH"){
       this->currentState = State::NewGaitSelected;
   }
   break;    

-  Create a new state for your selected and activated gait.

.. code::

   case State::NewGaitSelected:
            if(triggerPress == "PUSH"){
                this->currentState = State::NewGaitActivated;
            }
            else if(joystickPress == "DOUBLE"){
                this->currentState = State::NewGait;
            }
            break;
   case State::NewGaitActivated:
            if(triggerPress == "EXIT_GAIT"){
                this->currentState = State::StandUp;
            }
            break;
            
- Add a new entry to the *stateToGaitMapping*. Do this by adding an extra line in the constructor of the
  *StateMachine.cpp*:

.. code::

    stateToGaitMapping[State::<name_activated_state>] = "<gait_name>";

**<name_activated_state>** name of the activated state

**<gait_name>** name of the gait

- Return the SD addresses of the image that should be drawn in the current state in the *getScreenImage()* method in *StateMachine.cpp*:

.. code::

  case State::NewGait:
      currentSdAddresses[0] = NewGait_Hi;
      currentSdAddresses[1] = NewGait_Lo;
      break;

- Add the created states in the *Statemachine.h*.

.. code::

   enum class State {NewGait,
                     NewGaitSelected,
                     NewGaitActivated};
                        
- Define the sector address of the images to be loaded on the screen in the *SD_sector_addresses.h*. These addresses can be found via the 4D Systems Workshop4 IDE software. First load the desired images on the uSD card, then find the sector addresses of said images via the generated .Gc file.

.. code::

   // NewGait
      #define NewGait_Hi     0x0000
      #define NewGait_Lo     0x0051
